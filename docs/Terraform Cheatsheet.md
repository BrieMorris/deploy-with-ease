# Terraform Cheat Sheet

## Core Concepts

### `Provider`

- A plugin that Terraform

### `Resource`

- A component within Terraform that represents a piece of infrastructure, such as a physical server, VM, network switch, etc.

### `Data Sources`

- Allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.

### `State`

- Terraform stores the state of managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real-world resources to your configuration.

### `Modules`

- Containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module can include resources, input variables, output values, and modules.

## Configuration Language

### `HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)`

- The JSON-compatible domain-specific language used by Terraform to define resources, data sources, providers, outputs, etc.

### `Variables`

- Allow customization of Terraform configurations without altering the code, and they can be set in multiple ways.

### `Outputs`

- A way to organize data to be easily queried and shown back to the Terraform user.

## Additional Concepts

### `Workspace`

- Workspaces are used in Terraform to manage multiple state files within the same configuration, enabling easier management of different environments (like production, development, staging).

### `Backend`

- The mechanism that Terraform uses to store state files. Backends can be local (default) or remote (like S3, Consul).

### `Provisioners`

- Used within Terraform to execute scripts or actions on the local machine or on a remote machine to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects.

### `Terraform Cloud`

- A HashiCorp service that provides cloud-based collaboration and automation features for Terraform users.

## Advanced Features

### `Sentinel Policy as Code`

- An embedded policy-as-code framework integrated within the Terraform ecosystem that enables fine-grained, logic-based policy decisions.

### `Terraform Registry`

- A repository of public and private modules and providers used in Terraform configurations.

### `Remote Operations`

- Feature in Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise that allows for execution of Terraform runs in a remote environment.

## Best Practices

### `Infrastructure as Code (IaC)`

- The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

### `Immutable Infrastructure`

- A paradigm that promotes the recreation of new infrastructure rather than updating existing infrastructure.

### `State Locking`

- A feature that prevents others from running Terraform commands against the same state, ensuring that the state is only modified by one operation at a time.

## Terraform Commands

### `init`

- Initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration by creating initial files, loading any modules, etc.

### `validate`

- Validates the syntax of the Terraform files.

### `fmt`

- Formats your local Terraform files in your project.

### `plan`

- Creates an execution plan, showing what actions Terraform will perform upon running `apply`.

### `apply`

- Applies the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a Terraform plan.

### `destroy`

- Removes all resources in the state file, effectively deleting the managed infrastructure.

### `refresh`

- Updates the local state file against real-world resources, making sure it matches the real current state.
